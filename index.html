        <p>Draco was born in 1980 as the only child of Lucius and Narcissa Malfoy who both believed in pureblood purity. His father, Lucius, had formerly been one of Lord Voldemort's greatest henchmen but was not as loyal to the Dark Lord as Voldemort believed. Lucius did nothing to search for Voldemort following the First Wizarding War, believing his master dead. However, Voldemort was alive, (albeit in a weakened state) knew of Lucius' lack of loyalty, and was furious. Meanwhile, Lucius was able to worm his way out of prison by saying he was influenced by the Imperius curse and was redeemed in the Minister's eyes. He used his wealth to influence the Ministry and make laws he thought suited his pureblood views better.</p>

        <p>Lucius believed Harry Potter to be an upcoming Dark wizard, like Voldemort, believing this to be the reason Harry defeated Voldemort. For this reason, Lucius told Draco to befriend Harry Potter as soon as they arrived at Hogwarts. Lucius thought a young Dark wizard (which he believed Harry to be) was one thing they should surely have on their side (as former Death Eaters). Lucius had also raised Draco to mourn Harry Potter's victory over Voldemort but not to show this publicly, otherwise, he would ruin Lucius' image. The day of celebration marking the Potter's triumph over He Who Must Not Be Named was seen as a tragic day for the Malfoys, rather than a holiday. Lucius was presumably furious when Draco revealed he had met Harry in Madam Malkin's robe shop. He asked Harry several questions about who he was and asked him about The Wizarding world but started mocking him after he realized Harry didn't know anything about the Wizarding World. He presumably saw this and was upset at Draco for having missed an opportunity, and ordered him to act further at charming Harry on his first day at Hogwarts.</p>
